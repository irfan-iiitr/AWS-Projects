# CI/CD with CodePipeline

## Let's put our CI/CD pipeline together and automate software releases!

✅ CodeCommit and CodeArtifact to save copies of your web app's code and its dependencies.

✅ CodeBuild to compile and package your app's source code into a handy WAR file.

✅ CodeDeploy to deploy that WAR file on servers, so users can see your web app!

⏭️ AWS CodePipeline is there to automate the integrations between CodeCommit, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy.
